## SlowKey: Advanced Key Derivation Tool Using Scrypt, Argon2id, SHA2, and SHA3

SlowKey is a cutting-edge [Key Derivation Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function) (KDF) tool designed to enhance cryptographic security in various applications, from securing sensitive data to protecting user passwords. At its core, SlowKey leverages the power of three renowned cryptographic algorithms: [Scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt), [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2), [SHA2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2), and [SHA3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3), each selected for its unique strengths in ensuring data integrity and security.

SlowKey incorporates Scrypt, a memory-hard KDF that is specifically engineered to make brute-force attacks prohibitively expensive. By requiring significant amounts of memory and processing power to compute the hash functions, Scrypt ensures that the cost and time to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks are beyond the reach of most attackers, offering robust protection against rainbow table and brute-force attacks.

SlowKey integrates Argon2, an advanced, memory-hard Key Derivation Function (KDF) designed to effectively thwart brute-force and side-channel attacks. As the winner of the Password Hashing Competition, Argon2 is tailored to ensure that the computation of hash functions demands substantial memory and processing resources, making it exceedingly difficult for attackers to mount large-scale custom hardware attacks. This requirement for significant computational effort not only increases the security against brute-force and rainbow table attacks but also provides a customizable framework that can be tuned for specific defense needs, ensuring an adaptable and formidable barrier against unauthorized access attempts.

Alongside Scrypt, and Argon2, SlowKey utilizes SHA2 and SHA3 for their exceptional hash functions, providing an additional layer of security. SHA2, a member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family, offers a high level of resistance against hash collision attacks, making it an excellent choice for secure hashing needs. SHA3, the latest member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family, further strengthens SlowKey's cryptographic capabilities with its resistance to various attack vectors, including those that may affect earlier SHA versions.

A cornerstone of SlowKey's design philosophy is its commitment to resilience through diversity. By integrating Scrypt, SHA2, and SHA3 within its cryptographic framework, SlowKey not only capitalizes on the unique strengths of each algorithm but also ensures a level of security redundancy that is critical in the face of evolving cyber threats. This strategic mixture means that even if one of these algorithms were to be compromised or "broken" due to unforeseen vulnerabilities, the overall security scheme of SlowKey would remain robust and intact, safeguarded by the uncompromised integrity of the remaining algorithms. This approach mirrors the principle of layered security in cybersecurity, where multiple defensive strategies are employed to protect against a single point of failure. Consequently, SlowKey offers an advanced, forward-thinking solution that anticipates and mitigates the potential impact of future cryptographic breakthroughs or advancements in quantum computing that could threaten individual hash functions. Through this multi-algorithm strategy, SlowKey provides a safeguard against the entire spectrum of cryptographic attacks, ensuring long-term security for its users in a landscape where the only constant is change.

## Build

### Mac OS

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lbeder/slowkey
cd slowkey

cargo build --release
```

Depending on whether you are using x64 or arm64, you might need to add either the `x86_64-apple-darwin` or the `aarch64-apple-darwin` target accordingly:

```sh
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
```

### Linux x86_x64

In order to get stuff working later, use the `nightly` branch of Rust:

```sh
rustup override set nightly
```

Install a standard Linux target on a Mac (note, that the opposite is currently impossible):

```sh
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

Use `homebrew` to install a community-provided macOS cross-compiler toolchains:

```sh
brew tap messense/macos-cross-toolchains
brew install x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

Now you can build it:

```sh
export CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl-gcc
export CXX_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl-g++
export AR_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl-ar
export CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_MUSL_LINKER=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl-gcc
CROSS_COMPILE=x86_64-linux-musl- cargo build --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
cargo build --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

### For Windows

In order to get stuff working later, use the `nightly` branch of Rust:

```sh
rustup override set nightly
```

Install the standard Windows target on a Mac (note, that the opposite is currently impossible):

```sh
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

Use `homebrew` to install mingw-w64:

```sh
brew install mingw-w64
```

Now you can build it:

```sh
cargo build --release --target=x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

## Examples

Let's try to derive the key for the password `secret`, using the salt `saltsaltsaltsalt`:

> slowkey derive

```sh
SlowKey: iterations: 100, length: 16, Scrypt: (n: 1048576, r: 8, p: 1), Argon2id: (version: 19, m_cost: 2097152, t_cost: 2)

Enter your salt (must be 16 characters/bytes long in either raw or hex format starting with 0x): saltsaltsaltsalt
Enter your password (in either raw or hex format starting with 0x): ðŸ”‘
Enter your password again: ðŸ”‘

Processing: 12 / 100 [==============>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------] 12.00 % 9m
```

Final result:

```sh
Enter your salt (must be 16 characters/bytes long in either raw or hex format starting with 0x): saltsaltsaltsalt
Enter your password (in either raw or hex format starting with 0x): ðŸ”‘
Enter your password again: ðŸ”‘

Processing: 100 / 100 [=======================================================================================================================================] 100.00 %

Key (hex) is (please highlight to see): dc4228e2b23375b3560166d8c822400b

Finished in 8m 9s
```

### Resuming Previous Derivation

To help with resuming previously stopped derivations, we're registering a `CTRL_C`, `CTRL_BREAK`, `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, and `SIGHUP` termination handler which will output the intermediary result (if possible).

For example, if we will abort the previous derivation after the `10th` iteration, the tool will output:

```sh
SlowKey: iterations: 100, length: 16, Scrypt: (n: 1048576, r: 8, p: 1), Argon2id: (version: 19, m_cost: 2097152, t_cost: 2)

Enter your salt (must be 16 characters/bytes long in either raw or hex format starting with 0x): saltsaltsaltsalt
Enter your password (in either raw or hex format starting with 0x): ðŸ”‘
Enter your password again: ðŸ”‘

Processing: 10 / 100 [==========================================================================>-------------------------------------------------] 10.00 % 7m

Terminated. To resume, please specify --offset 10 and --offset-data (please highlight to see) 9d3088829bb0d2049488215d2c96f62c
```

You can then use this output to resume the previous derivation by specifying a starting offset and data like so:

> slowkey derive --offset 10 --offset-data 9d3088829bb0d2049488215d2c96f62c

```sh
SlowKey: iterations: 100, length: 16, Scrypt: (n: 1048576, r: 8, p: 1), Argon2id: (version: 19, m_cost: 2097152, t_cost: 2)

Enter your salt (must be 16 characters/bytes long in either raw or hex format starting with 0x): saltsaltsaltsalt

Resuming from iteration 10 with intermediary offset data 9d3088829bb0d2049488215d2c96f62c

Processing: 90 / 90 [===============================================================================================================================] 100.00 % 8m

Key (hex) is (please highlight to see): dc4228e2b23375b3560166d8c822400b

Finished in 4m 15s
```

## Test Vectors

In order to verify the validity of the Scrypt calculation, you can pass the `-t/--test` flag.

Test vectors:

### #1
